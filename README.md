# QA Portfolio – Antonio Martínez
## 👋 About Me
I’m a QA Engineer passionate about applying my knowledge to ensure software quality and improve user experience.

I have hands-on experience in manual testing of web and API-based applications, including test case design, 
functional and regression testing, and API testing using Postman.

I enjoy analyzing requirements, identifying edge cases, and documenting bugs using Jira-style reports 
with clear steps, expected vs actual results, and severity.

Currently, I am building my QA portfolio through real-world projects completed during the TripleTen QA program.
